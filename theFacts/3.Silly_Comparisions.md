## Silly Comparisions - Unexpected Outputs
```js
    '' == 0				// true and
	0 == '0'			// true but
    '' == '0' 			// false unexpected

	false == undefined 	// false
	false == null 		// false
	null == undefined 	// true
	" \t\r\n" == 0 		// true
```
###### Why is that?
Implicit Casting happens only when LHS and RHS are different data types, but `''`,`'0'` are of same type, so it checks as `null` string is eaqual to string `0` which is not true.
Other's are just FYI

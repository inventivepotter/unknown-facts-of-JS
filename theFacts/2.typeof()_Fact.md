## Facts of typeof()

    typeof(null)				//"object"			
    typeof(NaN)					//"number"
    typeof null === 'object';	// true
    typeof null === 'null';		// false
   	typeof alert === 'object'	// true in IE
   	typeof alert				//"function" in all browsers except IE

#### Why is that?
In short: It is bug in ECMAScript, and the type should be "null" for "typeof null".
The ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard specifies that Numbers are IEEE 757 floats, which include NaN as a possible value.


### Named Vs Unnamed Functions

	var fun = function red(){return 1;}
	function blue(){return 2;}
	typeof fun											//"function"
	typeof red											//"undefined"
	typeof blue 										//"function"
	typeof fun()										//"number"
	typeof red()										//Error: Uncaught ReferenceError: red is not defined(â€¦)
	typeof blue()										//"number"

####Why is that?
Because named function 'fun' and 'typeof fun' are in the same scope, but 'red' and 'typeof red' are in different scope. So it doesn't know what it is and spit out as "undefined". If you see 'blue()' which is in same scope of 'typeof blue' returned you it as 'function'. The next three are printing that return value of function.


### Inside a named function

	(function(){
		var fun1 = function red(){
			console.log(typeof red);
			return 1;
		}
		console.log(typeof red);						//"undefined"
		fun1();											//"function"
	})();

####Why is that?
Because within the scope of red(), red is a function but not out side of red().
